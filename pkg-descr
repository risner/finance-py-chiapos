Chia's proof of space is written in C++. Includes a plotter, prover, and
verifier. It exclusively runs on 64 bit architectures. Read the Proof of
Space document to learn about what proof of space is and how it works.

Note (where should these go?):
The GHC reference has nothing to do with Haskell.
HellmanAttacks is experimental, and does not currently compile.
