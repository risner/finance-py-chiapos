Chia's proof of space is written in C++. Includes a plotter, prover, and
verifier. It exclusively runs on 64 bit architectures. Read the Proof of
Space document to learn about what proof of space is and how it works.

Notes:
Any ghc references are not Haskell related, rather a developer initials.
The HellmanAttacks example is experimental and incomplete upstream.

This port is for the Python module (library).
